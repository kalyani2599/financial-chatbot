# financial-chatbot

The chatbot is a web-based application built using Flask, a Python web framework. It serves as a tool to provide simplified and summarized financial insights to users. The chatbot operates by matching predefined user queries to corresponding responses based on the analyzed financial data.

Predefined queries that the chatbot can respond to include:

"What is the total revenue?"
"How has net income changed over the last year?"
(Additional queries can be added as needed)
Upon receiving a user query, the chatbot processes the input and generates a response tailored to the specific query. It aims to communicate complex financial concepts in an accessible manner, using clear language and avoiding technical jargon.

However, the chatbot has certain limitations:

It can only respond to predefined queries and may not handle open-ended questions effectively.
The responses provided are based on static data and may not reflect real-time changes or dynamic market conditions.
The chatbot's ability to interpret nuanced queries or provide in-depth analysis is limited compared to human expertise.
Overall, while the chatbot serves as a useful tool for accessing basic financial information and insights, users should be mindful of its limitations and seek additional resources or expert advice for complex financial analysis and decision-making.
